/*
----------------------- TYPES OF BINARY TREES --------------------------------

    1.Full or Strict Binary Tree:
        All Nodes have either 0 or 2 child (No 1 child).
    2.Perfect Binary Tree:
        Internal Node have two children + All Leaf Nodes are on same level.
    3.Complete Binary Tree:
        All levels are completely filled Except the Last level + In the last level the keys must 'left' If possible(IN some cases its not possible)
    4.Degenerate Binary Tree:
        All Internal Nodes have only 1 children.
        Degenerate trees are of two Skewed tree types:
            1.Left Skewed trees:
                Degenarate tree that is 'Left Alligning'
            2.Right Skewed trees:
                Dgenerate tree that is 'Right Alligning'.
