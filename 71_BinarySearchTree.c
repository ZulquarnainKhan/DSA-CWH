// -------------------- BINARY SEARCH TREE [BST] ----------------------
/*
Properties of Binary Search Trees:
    1.All Nodes of the left Subtree are Lesser than the node.
    2.All Nodes of the right Subtree are Greater than the node.
    3.Left and Right Subtrees must also be BST (BinarySearchTree).
    4.There are no duplicate Nodes
   *5.INORDER traversal of BST gives us an ascending sorted array  ----> IMPORTANT
